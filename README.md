## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- learned to use ```display:table``` for centering

- learned to center everything vertically with:
```
CSS
body {
  height: 100vh;
}
```

- the use of 'mix-blend-mode' , but didn't got the desired outcome

### Continued development

- need to develop organized css codes with less repition and use of margin/padding
- improve HTMl semantics
- learn more properties along the way

### Useful resources
